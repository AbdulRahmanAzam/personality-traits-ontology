## How These Questions Combine with Big Five

### Example Integration Logic

**High Conscientiousness + Career Goal: Start Business + Challenge: Work-Life Balance**
→ Guidance focuses on: "Your discipline is an asset for entrepreneurship, but you need to consciously create boundaries. Your tendency for thoroughness may lead to overwork. Schedule non-negotiable personal time like a business meeting."

**High Neuroticism + Career Goal: Leadership + Challenge: Managing Stress**
→ Guidance focuses on: "Leadership is possible with your profile, but requires proactive stress management. Consider: executive coaching for nervous leaders, CBT techniques, roles where you can control the pace. Your emotional awareness can become empathy-based leadership."

**Low Extraversion + Environment: Large Corporation + Challenge: Networking**
→ Guidance focuses on: "Large corporations offer paths that don't require extensive networking. Focus on: becoming a recognized expert (people come to you), strategic 1-on-1 relationships over large events, written communication where you excel."
